Guiro talks about elegance, imbalanced equilibrium.
Moving characters on the verge of rupture, falling, a graphical universe, playful, an original style. 
Always a hint of humour, a double reading, each piece tells a story.

Motion Creator, he tries to bend metal at its convenience.
With steel and stainless steel, he creates its threadlike characters, always light, always vibrant in their balance.

His figures are full of grace and cheerfulness.
Guiro created sculpture for different [public procurements]({{site.url}}/order) notably in Guidel(France) and Parès(Spain).
